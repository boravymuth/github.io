# About Me
My name is **Muth Boravy**, was born in Battambang province, Cambodia. Currently I work at [Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC)](https://itc.edu.kh/about-institute-of-technology-of-cambodia/) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, as mathematics lecturer at Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics. 

## Education
> * Bachelor degree: Nuclear Engineering (2009-2013) at National University of Battambang, Cambodia.
> * Master degree: Nuclear Engineering (2015-2017) at KINGS, Ulsan, South Korea.
> * Ph.D: Nuclear Engineering (2017-2021) at Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea.
  * **Master Thesis:** _Parametric study on burnable absorber rod to control excess reactivity for a soluble boron free small modular reactor (2017)._
  * **PhD Thesis:** _A design of multilayer shielding of metal hydride coupled with heavy metal for simultaneously sheiding neutron and gamma-rays (2020)._
